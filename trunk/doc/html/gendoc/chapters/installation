<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
Code-Gallery installation (at the moment) is based on a shellscript
called installer.sh<br/>
With the shellscript you can easily install this program as root (using prefix /usr)
or as a user (using prefix ~/.code-gallery and ~/bin for symbolic links).
</p>

<p>
To install the program simply launch the shellscript using <br/>
<code>sh installer.sh</code>
</p>

<p>
The shellscript will automagically detect if you have root privileges
and (always automagically ;-) ) will allow you an environment installation.
Otherwise (eg: you are a normal user) you can perform a local installation only.
</p>

<p>
Once the shellscript detects your rights it will display some simple questions.
Answer to them with either Y or N. Questions are very simple to understand
so we don't explain them here.
