Welcome to the Code-Gallery documentation. This document describes different aspects of this program
from installation to everyday-use.

This documentation was generated by GenDoc, a simple bash scripts that allows documenters
to use only one template page for all documentation without changing every page separately.
Please note that this isn't a professional tool but is quite useful for writing small amounts
of documentation
