XCode-Gallery requirements
(by Lorenzo Villani - Arbiter)

xcode-gallery is a gui frontend so it needs
X, but it's not the only requirement in order
to use it. Follows a list of requirements with
URL for downloads.

* Python: A minimum required version of the interpreter
  is 2.3.5

* WxPython - the wxWidgets python bindings: 
  For windows and Machintosh this is the only requirement,
  in fact, WxPython includes the wxWidgets library inside 
  the package. On linux you will need to install the wxWidget
  package, you can freely choose to compile it with gtk+ 1.2 
  ir gtk 2.x support. For linux there are packages only for RPM
  based distributions and an ebuild for gentoo linux
  distro. NON LINUX USERS NOTE: (MAC) You don't have to install
  the X server that comes with Macintosh because wxWidgets
  uses native Cocoa Frameworks (not gtk) - (WINDOWS) Same
  as MAC in fact, on Windows, wxWidgets uses native MFC
  Framework to create the interface.
