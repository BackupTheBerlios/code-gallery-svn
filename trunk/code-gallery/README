Abstract
--------
Code-Gallery generates a gallery for your photos, providing several layouts and CSS styles, in order to let you choose a complex page if you don't need to edit it or a basic one if you are planning to use just its code.

Requirements
------------
In order to run code-gallery, you need to install this software:

	[1] Python-2.x
	[2] ImageMagick-6.x
	
If you want to use the GTK gui, you also need:

	[3] >= GTK-2.6.0
	[4] >= PyGTK-2.6.0


Installation
------------
Unpack the tat.bz2 provided and cd into the dir:

	$ tar -xjf code-gallery-<release>.tar.bz2
	$ cd code-gallery-<release>

Now, switch user to root. If you don't have the permission, you can do it as user.
Execute the installer and follow the instructions. At the end of the installation, 2 files will be created under /bin ( ~/bin ), and a new directory under /usr/share ( ~/.code-gallery/ ):

	$ su -
	# ./installer.sh


Running code-gallery
